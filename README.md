Motivation
-----------

I needed a way to map chords to my Launchpad to play in user1 mode. 
The idea was simple: before performance I would map some chords to
a few consecutive pads, save them as a preset then play them on stage. 
Initially, I tried to use the Schwarzonator2.0 M4L device by Henrik Schwarz 
(https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/schwarzonator/), but I had a hard
time recalling saved presets with its external storage system.
(Needless to mention that the internal device 'Chord' is a pain to
map so it was out of the question). So I ended up creating my own one.


Features
--------

- map chords to 8 banks using the mouse
- play chords hitting a single note
- ideal for Launchpad or similar trigger-like controllers
- state is automatically saved with your Live set
- save presets with the 'Save Preset' button on the device title bar (NO EXTERNAL MESS!)


Installation
--------
Simply copy Kordz3.amxd to ABLETON_USER_LIBRARY_LOCATION/Presets/MIDI Effects/Max MIDI Effect
